<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/doombubbles/paths-plus-plus">THIS MOD REQUIRES PATHS++</a></h3>

This mod adds a fourth upgrade path to the Alchemist.

Below you'll find a list of upgrades, as well as some notes about balance and design. This is a mod so don't expect perfect balance, but I am a game design nerd so I try to put a lot of thought into my design choices.

<h2>Uprade Info:</h2>

<h3>Tier 1: Lingering Potions</h3>

$360

<h4>Description:</h4>

Potions can damage bloons multiple times if they have remaining pierce. Also increases duration for the acid status effect, berserker brew and acid pools.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- Alchemist potions now deal a second and third hit of damage after the first at 0.2 second intervals.
- Acid pools will also now rehit bloons every 0.2 seconds.
- Acid DOT now lasts for 2 seconds longer (1 more damage tick)
- Berserker Brew and Stronger Stimulant now last 3 seconds longer. This is enough to permanently buff one tower with regular Berserker Brew. However, this upgrade does not increase the number of attacks that the brew lasts for.
- Acid pools now last for 3 seconds longer.
- Because the damage bonus vs Moabs and Fortified Moabs from Perishing Potions was so powerful when paired with Lingering Potions, these are nerfed from 4 -> 2 and 15 -> 6 respectively when you get this upgrade. (Don't worry, it still works out to an increase in total damage vs single targets)

Vanilla alchemist is terrible early game, and always has been. Also, the Acid Pools upgrade is so useless it's become a sort of meme at this point. I designed this upgrade to give them a chance at being a viable early-game tower, as well as a reason to use Acid Pools. Although it still suffers from inaccuracy against fast bloons, an alchemist with this upgrade can be a cheap way to bring heavy dps in the extreme early game, as well as synergizing well with middle path later for some Moab damage in a pinch or with bottom path for all-round better dps.

<h3>Tier 2: Insight</h3>

$270

<h4>Description:</h4>

Grants camo detection and increased range.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- Range increased from 45 -> 55

A pretty standard upgrade, but nonetheless I thought it would fit in well with alchemist since, fun fact: alchemist is the only attacking tower which cannot pop camo no matter what without assistance from another tower.

<h3>Tier 3: Life Transmutation</h3>

$1200

<h4>Description:</h4>

Potions instantly vaporize regen bloons and turn them into lives.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- Splash attack one-shots regrow bloons.
- Gives 1 life per regrow bloon popped.
- Before you ask, no you cannot create a regrow farm to infinitely farm lives. Duplicated bloons will not give lives, just like they don't give cash when popped.

This upgrade mirrors Lead to Gold in that it's useless for most rounds but on a select few it is incredibly OP. Even on CHIMPS where lives are irrelevant, it can be used to effectively neutralize rounds like 76 and 79.

<h3>Tier 4: Elemental Reagent</h3>

$2000

<h4>Description:</h4>

This mystical substance comes in bigger flasks and deals heavy bonus damage to anything that is glued, frozen, electrified, or on fire. Gains additional +1 damage for every subsequent effect if more than 1 are applied!

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- This upgrade gives +4 bonus damage towards bloons with the status effects listed above.
- This upgrade grants an additional +1 damage for each status effect beyond the first one, for a total of +7 damage if all four are applied on the same bloon.
- This upgrade also gives +50% attack speed, adds +5 pierce (+15 with Bigger Potions) and +3 splash radius.

I figured alchemist could use a path with a more traditional dps role, seeing as all their other paths are either support, extremely niche, or ability-based. Thus, the 4th tier buffs its attack a lot, while still getting that gimmicky alchemist play style by relying heavily on its synergy with status effects. If you have some sort of setup to reliably apply glue, ice, shock, or fire to lots of bloons, this tower is an incredibly cost-effective source of dps against both bloons and Moabs. Glue is a lot easier to set up than the other 3 effects, but the cascading bonus damage gives some incentive to explore the other effects as well. Finally, a reason to use laser shock on your middle path dartlings!

<h3>Tier 5: Philosopher's Stone</h3>

$45000

<h4>Description:</h4>

The power of the stone grants any monkey that holds it supermonkey strength. Equivalent Exchange Ability: empties your wallet and deals as much damage as you had cash to every bloon on screen.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- Quadruples base attack speed and gives +1 base damage
- Adds another +5 pierce (+10 with Bigger Potions), +3 splash radius and +10 range.
- Ability has a 60 second cooldown.
- Acid Pools get +5 pierce

If the "supermonkey strength" bit of the description didn't clue you in, this upgrade increases the alchemist's base attack power by a lot. If paired with the right status effects, it can deliver a significant amount of damage even in late game. However, that alone is not enough to justify its cost. The ability requires careful money management and future planning to utilize properly, but if you are able to end up with just enough cash in hand on a particularly tough round, you can guarantee a win against that round at a lower cost than it would take to build a permanent defense. You can also use this in bosses to sort of stockpile damage against the boss before it even spawns by farming like crazy.
